# Introduction

From 2012 to 2019, I worked at [MyDailyLifestyle](http://www.mydailylifestyle.com), an organization dedicated to helping companies enhance the health of their employees.

The employees follow a program lasting several weeks and receive new tasks each week. Examples include:

- Fill out a day in the food diary
- Complete a questionnaire
- Watch a video
- Read a text
- Listen to an audio file
- Enter your weight

On a desktop screen, this task list looked like this:

{% include framework/shortcodes/figure.html src="/assets/images/gen/content/blog-mdl/actions-desktop.jpg" title="Task list for participants - desktop view" %}

Unfortunately, not all participants always completed all tasks. According to my employer, the task list appeared boring and uninviting. A more engaging format could lead to better responses. My assignment was to find a different format for the same tasks that resembled a game more. The focus was on the mobile app; we would not adjust the desktop view to save time. Therefore, the new format had to be compatible with it.

### My role

- Concept development
- Wireframing
- Visual design

# Concept development and wireframing
I evetually came up with the following idea:

{% include framework/shortcodes/figure.html src="/assets/images/gen/content/blog-mdl/actions-mobile-wireframe.png" title="Wireframe task list (mobile view)" %}

Above, you see the program tasks for the participant for the current week. Each task is a square block that covers a photo in the background. By tapping on such a block, you go to a subsequent page, where there are several variations depending on the nature of the task. Here is an example:

{% include framework/shortcodes/figure.html src="/assets/images/gen/content/blog-mdl/read.png" title="Wireframe detail page of a task" %}

When the user has completed a task, the corresponding block disappears from the task overview page (with an animation). This reveals another part of the photo. In this way, the user is encouraged to clear all blocks by completing all tasks. When a new week begins, new tasks and a new background photo appear.

Most weeks contain 5 or 6 tasks. If there are only 5, the user receives 1 block as a gift at the start of the week, which is already removed in advance. If a week contains more than 5 or 6 tasks, all task blocks become smaller.

# Visual design
My employer was enthusiastic, so I received the green light for a visual design:

{% include framework/shortcodes/figure.html src="/assets/images/gen/content/blog-mdl/actions-visual-design.png" title="Visual design task list" %}

{% include framework/shortcodes/figure.html src="/assets/images/gen/content/blog-mdl/read-visual-design.png" title="Visual design detail page of a task" %}

# Implementation
The entire mobile app, of which the task list is a part, was created by an external developer. I only oversaw the execution.

# Result
My employer was very satisfied and demonstrated this component with great enthusiasm to potential clients.
