# Introduction

From 2005 to 2010 I worked with two co-founders on 'Vitamine P', a puzzle/braintraining website. It presented five new puzzles each day in five categories. It was aimed at the elderly, who at the time of this project were not very computer savvy yet. Therefore, we paid a lot of attention to the UI, which was very straight forward and consistent across all puzzles. Additionally, each puzzle contained animated help instructions. This page lists all the puzzles we created, notice how similar the UI was.

The website kept track of your personal PQ, or puzzle performance. Most of the puzzles were generated in advance and were identical for all players, allowing users to chat about the puzzles with each other. We sold Vitamine P to Keesing, part of De Telegraaf, the largest Dutch newspaper.
