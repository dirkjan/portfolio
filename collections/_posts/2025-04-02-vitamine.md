# Introduction

From 2005 to 2010, I worked with two co-founders on 'Vitamine P' (Vitamin P), a puzzle/brain training website. It presented five new puzzles each day in five categories. It was aimed at the elderly, who at the time of this project were not very computer savvy yet. Therefore, we paid a lot of attention to the UI, which was very straightforward and consistent across all puzzles. Additionally, each puzzle contained animated help instructions. This page lists all the puzzles we created; notice how similar the UI was.

The website kept track of your personal PQ, or puzzle performance. Most of the puzzles were generated in advance and were identical for all players, allowing users to chat about the puzzles with each other.

We sold Vitamine P to Keesing, part of De Telegraaf, the largest Dutch newspaper.

### My role

- Concept development (I came up with most of the puzzles, I marked my ideas below)
- Development of the puzzles in Flash ActionScript (all puzzles, ActionScript is similar to JavaScript)

# Five levels per puzzle
Each puzzle can be played on 5 levels. A higher level often means a larger playfield. Here is an example:

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 1rem;">
  <div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem;">
    <span><img style="margin: 0;" src="{{ '/assets/images/gen/content/blog-vitamine/levels/level1.png' | relative_url }}" /></span>
    <span><img style="margin: 0;" src="{{ '/assets/images/gen/content/blog-vitamine/levels/level2.png' | relative_url }}" /></span>
    <span><img style="margin: 0;" src="{{ '/assets/images/gen/content/blog-vitamine/levels/level3.png' | relative_url }}" /></span>

    <span><img style="margin: 0;" src="{{ '/assets/images/gen/content/blog-vitamine/levels/level4.png' | relative_url }}" /></span>
    <span><img style="margin: 0;" src="{{ '/assets/images/gen/content/blog-vitamine/levels/level5.png' | relative_url }}" /></span>
    <span><img src=""/></span>
  </div>
</figure>

Tweaking the right difficulty took us a lot of time and effort.

# Puzzles in the category 'Logic'

{% include framework/shortcodes/figure.html src="/assets/images/gen/content/blog-vitamine/logic/oplichter.png" title="Illuminator" border="false" %}

Place one or more lamps next to each red square. The number of lamps is specified inside the red square. Each lamp broadcasts light horizontally and vertically. When you are done, all the grey squares should be illuminated. [Watch a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz0bn8i5-Fs)

{% include framework/shortcodes/figure.html src="/assets/images/gen/content/blog-vitamine/logic/sla-je-slag.png" title="Make your move" border="false"  %}

Capture stones like in checkers until only one remains. [Watch a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKwrKQ-TdYs)

{% include framework/shortcodes/figure.html src="/assets/images/gen/content/blog-vitamine/logic/wisseltruc.png" title="Swap trick" border="false" %}

**Conceived by me.** Each stone can be swapped with its horizontal or vertical neighbor. You may make a limited number of swaps. When you are done, each stone must have at least one horizontal or vertical neighbor of the same color. [Watch a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C43cD79XUeQ&pp=0gcJCY0JAYcqIYzv)

{% include framework/shortcodes/figure.html src="/assets/images/gen/content/blog-vitamine/logic/zoek-groep.png" title="Find the group" border="false" %}

**Conceived by me.** Each stone has three properties: shape, color, and filling. A correct group meets the following two requirements:

- The stones in the group are in a straight line next to or below each other.
- For each property, such as color, all stones in the group must either be the same or all different.

Find all groups. [Watch a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHzZZek8TCY)

# Puzzles in the category 'Spatial'

{% include framework/shortcodes/figure.html src="/assets/images/gen/content/blog-vitamine/spatial/doorschuiver.png" title="Slider" border="false" %}

**Conceived by me.** A sliding puzzle with a twist. With an arrow key, you shift an entire row or column. If a photo box slides out of view, it reappears on the opposite side.

# Puzzles in the category 'Memory'

{% include framework/shortcodes/figure.html src="/assets/images/gen/content/blog-vitamine/memory/poortwachter.png" title="Gate keeper" border="false" %}

{% include framework/shortcodes/figure.html src="/assets/images/gen/content/blog-vitamine/memory/zoek-dader.png" title="Find the culprit" border="false" %}
