# BuyBay: icon libraries

BuyBay specializes in taking returned products from webshops, assessing and improving them, and reselling them. To streamline the assessment process, BuyBay developed flexible 'grading' software as a SaaS solution. I created various icons for this software.

### 3D icons
Options in the BuyBay grading workflows have large buttons, so that they are easy to hit. I created dozens of large 3D icons for these buttons. Here are a few samples.

{% include framework/shortcodes/figures.html
  path="/assets/images/gen/content/blog-illustration/grading-icons"
  files="azertyKeyboard.png,deepClean_true.png,exceptionReason_emptyPackage.png|packageState_original_opened_damaged_replace.png,productStateExpert_not_functional.png,ukPlug.png"
  padding="1rem"
  background_color="#D3EFCB"
%}

The icons are easily recognizable as a family, because they share the same perspective. [Read more on the context of these icons](/blog/2025-03-31-grading-visual-design/)

# Quiz and website hosts

From 2000 to 2012, I co-owned a web design agency. For some of the clients, I created animated hosts that accompanied websites or online quizzes.

  path="/assets/images/gen/content/blog-illustration"
  files="flits.png,sonja.png,null"
  title="Political reporter Flits and Sonja, the charming assistant of studieweb.nl"
%}

{% include framework/shortcodes/figure.html

  title="Water droplets Sim and Avi, hosts of a website for the Simavi foundation about water"
%}

  files="pikwisso.gif,beeld/pikwisso.gif,dans/pikwisso.gif|drama/pikwisso.gif,literatuur/pikwisso.gif,muziek/pikwisso.gif"
  flex="-1"
  title="Cultural host Piquizzo (unfortunately the animations were lost, but I managed to save a few stills)"

# BuyBay: comic

BuyBay specializes in taking returned products from webshops, assessing and improving them, and reselling them through online sales channels. I created a comic that illustrates the company's process.

  title="BuyBay process: page 1"

# Graphic novels

I wrote two graphic novels, De Hemingway triatlon (The Hemingway Triathlon, 2019) and Mao's Mussen (Mao's Sparrows, 2013). I wrote the stories, drew all the pages and I designed the covers (I received some aid from Peter Kuiper for the cover of De Hemingway triatlon).

{% include framework/shortcodes/figures.html
  path="/assets/images/gen/content/blog-illustration/books"
  files="mussen-cover.jpg,hemingway-cover.png"
  title="Covers from <b>De Hemingway triatlon</b> and <b>Mao's mussen</b>"

{% include framework/shortcodes/figure.html
  src="/assets/images/gen/content/blog-illustration/books/page_118.png"
  title="Page from De Hemingway triatlon"
%}
